# Chapter 2: Profitability Benchmarking – CATL vs. A-Share Peers (2024Q3–2025Q2)

This chapter presents a quantitative comparison of profitability metrics among China’s leading A-share battery manufacturers—Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), BYD, and Gotion High-Tech—over the past four quarters (2024Q3 to 2025Q2). The analysis highlights CATL’s sustained leadership, BYD’s structural trade-offs, and Gotion’s competitive challenges.

## 2.1 Gross Margin Trends

Gross margin reflects a company’s ability to control production costs and maintain pricing power. As shown in Figure 1, CATL consistently maintains gross margins between 24% and 28%, significantly outperforming both BYD (18–21%) and Gotion (16–18%).

The heatmap in Figure 2 further visualizes this dispersion, with CATL occupying the upper-right quadrant of high-margin performance throughout the period.

## 2.2 Net Profit Margin Comparison

Net profit margin incorporates operating efficiency, tax management, and non-core income. CATL’s net margins range from 15% to 18%, demonstrating robust bottom-line performance (Figure 3). In contrast, BYD’s net margins remain stable but low at approximately 4–5.5%, while Gotion struggles below 3.3%.

The stacked bar chart in Figure 4 illustrates how CATL’s net margin expansion from 2024Q4 to 2025Q2 coincides with industry-wide lithium price declines, suggesting superior cost pass-through or operational leverage.

## 2.3 Return on Equity (ROE) Evolution

ROE measures how effectively equity capital is deployed to generate profits. CATL’s ROE peaked at 22.8% in 2024Q4 and remained above 11% in 2025Q2 (Figure 5), reflecting strong asset utilization. BYD’s ROE hovers around 7–8%, consistent with its capital-intensive automotive operations. Gotion’s ROE remains below 5%, indicating suboptimal capital efficiency.

## 2.4 Q2 2025 Performance Snapshot

The latest available quarter (2025Q2) provides a clear cross-sectional view:

| Company   | Gross Margin | Net Profit Margin | ROE    |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **CATL**  | 25.0%        | 18.1%             | 11.3%  |
| **BYD**   | 18.0%        | 4.3%              | 7.4%   |
| **Gotion**| 16.4%        | 1.7%              | 1.4%   |

## 2.5 Interpretation: Drivers of Divergence

- **CATL**: Benefits from economies of scale, premium technology (e.g., Qilin battery, sodium-ion), and diversified global customer base (Tesla, BMW, NIO), enabling stronger pricing power.
- **BYD**: Vertical integration dilutes battery segment profitability; automotive manufacturing absorbs significant R&D and capex, compressing margins despite strong overall cash flow.
- **Gotion**: Faces higher customer concentration risk and limited scale, resulting in weaker bargaining power with both suppliers and OEMs.

### Mismatch with Prior Chapters

**None identified.** This chapter aligns with Chapter 1’s methodology by using MECE decomposition (separating gross margin, net margin, and ROE as distinct drivers) and Pareto focus (highlighting CATL as the dominant performer explaining most of the sector’s profitability variance). All data sources and limitations noted in Chapter 1 are respected.
