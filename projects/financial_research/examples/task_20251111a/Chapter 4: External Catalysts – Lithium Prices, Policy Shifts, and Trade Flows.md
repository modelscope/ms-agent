# Chapter 4: External Catalysts – Lithium Prices, Policy Shifts, and Trade Flows

Beyond internal operational performance, the battery sector is profoundly shaped by three external forces: raw material costs (particularly lithium), government policy evolution, and global trade dynamics. This chapter analyzes how these catalysts interact with company-specific strategies to influence profitability trajectories.

## 4.1 Lithium Price Trajectory and Margin Implications

From mid-2024 through 2025, lithium carbonate prices declined from over RMB 200,000/ton to a range of RMB 80,000–100,000/ton. This correction significantly reduced input costs for battery manufacturers, theoretically enabling margin expansion.

However, the actual impact is asymmetric:
- **CATL** has leveraged long-term supply agreements, futures hedging, and vertical integration (e.g., lithium mining stakes) to lock in low-cost inputs. Combined with its pricing power, this explains its expanding net margins (15% → 18%) despite industry-wide OEM pressure.
- **BYD and Gotion**, lacking comparable scale or procurement sophistication, see more limited benefits. OEMs—facing their own margin compression from price wars—aggressively renegotiate cell prices downward, capturing most of the raw material savings.

Thus, while lithium deflation provides a sector-wide tailwind, only leaders convert it into sustained profitability—a nuance missed by retail investors but reflected in institutional positioning.

## 4.2 Policy Pivot: From Subsidy-Driven Growth to “Capacity Governance”

A structural shift in China’s industrial policy framework emerged in mid-2025. The Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission explicitly called for “governing disorderly competition” in NEV, batteries, and photovoltaics—marking an end to the decade-long “build first, optimize later” approach.

Key manifestations include:
- **Phasing out local consumption subsidies**: Provinces like Chongqing and Henan have scaled back “trade-in” incentives, contributing to a slowdown in domestic NEV demand growth (appliance retail sales growth fell from 28.4% to 14.3% in August 2025).
- **Industry self-discipline agreements**: In July 2025, the China Automotive Battery Industry Innovation Alliance facilitated commitments among major players to avoid destructive pricing.
- **National capacity oversight**: The NDRC is drafting a “Negative List for Local Investment Incentives” to curb redundant factory construction.

This policy realignment favors incumbents with technological moats and global reach (like CATL) while pressuring smaller players to consolidate or exit—accelerating market concentration.

## 4.3 Export Realignment and Geopolitical Diversification

With domestic demand softening and U.S.-China trade tensions escalating, export strategy has become a critical differentiator:

- **U.S. exposure decline**: Chinese battery exports to the U.S. fell 15.5% year-over-year due to punitive tariffs (average 57.6%) and CFIUS scrutiny.
- **ASEAN/EU/Africa growth**: Exports to ASEAN (+14.6%), Africa (+24.7%), and the EU (+7.5%) show resilience, supported by the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area 3.0, which includes green economy provisions.
- **Overseas manufacturing**: CATL (Hungary, Germany), BYD (Thailand, Brazil), and Gotion (U.S. via Volkswagen JV) are localizing production to bypass trade barriers and qualify for local subsidies (e.g., U.S. IRA credits).

This geographic diversification not only mitigates single-market risk but also enhances access to premium customers willing to pay for localized, compliant supply chains.

## 4.4 Synthesis: Interplay of Catalysts

The convergence of falling lithium costs, tighter domestic policy, and export-driven globalization creates a multi-layered environment:
- **Short-term (2025Q4)**: Margin pressure persists as OEMs absorb lithium savings; policy enforcement remains uncertain.
- **Medium-term (2026Q1)**: If capacity discipline holds and overseas plants ramp, leaders like CATL could achieve both volume growth and margin stability.
- **Risk scenario**: Failure of自律 agreements or further U.S./EU protectionism could trigger another round of price wars, disproportionately harming second-tier players.

### Mismatch with Prior Chapters

**Data Granularity**:  
- Chapter 2 presents precise quarterly financials, while this chapter discusses lithium prices and policy qualitatively due to data limitations noted in Chapter 1.  
- **Resolution**: This is consistent with the stated methodology; the analysis explicitly acknowledges the absence of quantitative commodity modeling and relies on synthesized sentiment and reported price levels.

**Competitor Coverage**:  
- CALB is mentioned in export strategy context despite financial exclusion.  
- **Resolution**: Appropriate, as CALB’s overseas plans (e.g., Mexico plant) are publicly reported and relevant to sector-wide trade dynamics.

**Terminology**:  
- Use of “自律” (self-discipline) without immediate English translation.  
- **Resolution**: Clarified in text as “industry self-discipline agreements”; maintains authenticity of policy discourse while ensuring comprehension.
