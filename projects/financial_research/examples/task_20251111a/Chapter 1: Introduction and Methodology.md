# Chapter 1: Introduction and Methodology

## 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This report addresses the user's request to analyze the profitability of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL, 300750.SZ) over the past four quarters (2024Q3–2025Q2) in comparison with key competitors in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) battery sector—specifically BYD (002594.SZ), Gotion High-Tech (国轩高科, 002074.SZ), and CALB (中创新航). The analysis further incorporates contextual factors including lithium price dynamics, evolving government policies, and market sentiment to forecast performance for the next two quarters (2025Q4–2026Q1).

The geographic focus is the Chinese A-share market, with supplementary consideration of global trade flows and geopolitical developments affecting export-oriented battery manufacturers.

## 1.2 Data Sources and Collection

### Financial Data
- Quarterly income statements and DuPont analysis metrics for CATL, BYD, and Gotion were sourced from official A-share regulatory filings (2024Q3–2025Q2).
- Key profitability indicators include gross margin, net profit margin, and return on equity (ROE).
- **Limitation**: CALB, listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, was excluded due to data accessibility constraints within the current analytical toolset.

### Sentiment and Contextual Data
- Public discourse was gathered from major Chinese financial media (Caixin, Wind, Sina Finance), social platforms (Weibo, Xueqiu), and international outlets (Bloomberg).
- Coverage spans July 2024 to November 2025, capturing investor reactions to earnings releases, policy announcements, and reputational incidents.
- Thematic coding identified narratives around lithium pricing, policy shifts, technological competition, and corporate governance.

## 1.3 Analytical Framework

This report integrates three foundational principles to ensure rigor and clarity:

### MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
Profitability drivers are decomposed into non-overlapping categories:
- **Internal operational efficiency** (e.g., scale, yield, vertical integration)
- **External pricing power** (e.g., OEM negotiation strength, technology differentiation)
- **Macro-environmental factors** (e.g., lithium costs, policy incentives, trade barriers)

This structure ensures comprehensive coverage without double-counting.

### Pareto (80/20) Principle
Analysis prioritizes the "vital few" drivers that explain the majority of profitability variance:
- CATL’s margin leadership is attributed to its dominant scale and R&D pipeline.
- BYD’s financial resilience stems from its integrated automotive-battery model.
- Gotion’s underperformance reflects customer concentration and cost structure disadvantages.

### SWOT → TOWS Strategic Mapping
Chapter 5 employs SWOT to inventory CATL’s internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats, then derives actionable strategies through TOWS pairing (e.g., leveraging scale to capture ASEAN export growth amid U.S. tariff risks).

## 1.4 Report Structure

Following this methodology chapter, the report proceeds as:
- **Chapter 2**: Quantitative benchmarking of profitability metrics.
- **Chapter 3**: Qualitative analysis of market sentiment and reputational dynamics.
- **Chapter 4**: Examination of external catalysts—lithium, policy, and trade.
- **Chapter 5**: Forward-looking strategic outlook using SWOT/TOWS.
- **Chapter 6**: Conclusions and investment implications.

## 1.5 Limitations

- **Incomplete competitor set**: CALB’s absence limits full industry representation.
- **No direct commodity modeling**: Lithium price impact is inferred qualitatively due to data gaps.
- **Sentiment bias**: Social media may overrepresent retail investor views versus institutional perspectives.

Despite these constraints, the synthesis of hard financial data and soft sentiment signals provides a robust foundation for near-term forecasting.
