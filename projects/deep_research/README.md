在计算化学这个领域，我们通常使用Gaussian软件模拟各种情况下分子的结构和性质计算，比如在关键词中加入'field=x+100'代表了在x方向增加了电场。但是，当体系是经典的单原子催化剂时，它属于分子催化剂，在反应环境中分子的朝向是不确定的，那么理论模拟的x方向电场和实际电场是不一致的。

请问：通常情况下，理论计算是如何模拟外加电场存在的情况？

In the field of computational chemistry, we often use Gaussian software to simulate the structure and properties of molecules under various conditions. For instance, adding 'field=x+100' to the keywords signifies an electric field applied along the x-direction. However, when dealing with a classical single-atom catalyst, which falls under molecular catalysis, the orientation of the molecule in the reaction environment is uncertain. This means the x-directional electric field in the theoretical simulation might not align with the actual electric field.

So, how are external electric fields typically simulated in theoretical calculations?
