# Cross-Chapter Consistency Audit Summary

This document consolidates all "Mismatch with Prior Chapters" notes identified during the chapter-by-chapter generation process. Each inconsistency is categorized, resolved, and verified for final report integration.

## 1. Terminology Consistency
- **Issue**: Use of "Gotion" vs. "Gotion High-Tech" vs. "国轩高科".
- **Resolution**: Standardized to "Gotion" after first full mention in Chapter 2. All subsequent chapters comply.
- **Status**: Resolved.

## 2. CALB Coverage Scope
- **Issue**: Financial data exclusion (Chapters 1–2) vs. qualitative inclusion in sentiment and trade analysis (Chapters 3–5).
- **Resolution**: Explicitly justified in Chapter 3: CALB's public discourse and strategic plans are relevant to sector dynamics despite financial data unavailability. Final recommendation (Chapter 6) appropriately excludes CALB from investment advice due to lack of financial verification.
- **Status**: Resolved.

## 3. Data Granularity and Modeling Limitations
- **Issue**: Quantitative financials (Chapter 2) vs. qualitative lithium/policy analysis (Chapters 4–5).
- **Resolution**: Chapter 1 clearly states limitations regarding lithium price modeling and policy quantification. Subsequent chapters consistently acknowledge these constraints while using synthesized sentiment and reported data for inference.
- **Status**: Resolved.

## 4. SWOT Weakness Identification
- **Issue**: "Limited consumer brand recognition" introduced in Chapter 5 without prior mention.
- **Resolution**: Logically inferred from CATL's B2B model described in Chapter 3. No contradiction with earlier analysis.
- **Status**: Resolved.

## 5. Scenario Forecast Specificity
- **Issue**: Numerical margin forecasts (Chapter 5) vs. qualitative catalyst discussion (Chapter 4).
- **Resolution**: Forecasts are explicitly extrapolated from historical performance ranges (Chapter 2: 15–18% net margin) and adjusted for external factors—consistent with available data and methodology.
- **Status**: Resolved.

## 6. Investment Recommendation Alignment
- **Issue**: Directional advice ("overweight CATL") in Chapter 6 vs. scenario-based analysis in Chapter 5.
- **Resolution**: Recommendations are directly derived from scenario probabilities and financial benchmarks—no overreach beyond analytical foundation.
- **Status**: Resolved.

## Overall Assessment
All identified mismatches were minor, contextually justified, and resolved through explicit clarification or logical inference. The final report maintains internal consistency in data usage, terminology, scope boundaries, and analytical conclusions.
